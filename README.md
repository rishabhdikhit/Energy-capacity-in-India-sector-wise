# Energy Capacity Dashboard

This repository contains a Tableau dashboard for visualizing installed energy capacity data by sector and mode.

## Tableau Dashboard

The Tableau dashboard allows users to explore installed energy capacity data across different sectors and modes. Users can gain insights into energy capacity trends and distributions using interactive visualizations.

Explore the dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/installedenergycapacitysectowwise_/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## Data File

The data file "installed_energy_capacity_sector_mode_wise.csv" contains information on installed energy capacity categorized by sector and mode. The columns include:
- Sector: The sector of energy production (e.g., private, center, state).
- Mode: The mode of energy production (e.g., hydro, nuclear, thermal).
- Capacity: The installed capacity of energy production in megawatts (MW).

The data is sourced from [insert source] and has been preprocessed for use in the Tableau dashboard.
